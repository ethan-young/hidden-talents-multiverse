age,Interview: participant's age,
test_envr,Interviewer rating: interview: average of the four interviewer rated items regarding the data collection setting,
unp_perceived,"Questionnaire: Childhood Unpredictability, average score, higher scores mean higher levels of percieved  childhood unpredictability",
unp_interview,"Unpredictability: interview-based measure of unpredictabilty using parental figures, moves involving new people, and a disrupted family.
                       Variables were standardized before averageing. Higher scores mean more unpredictability",

                       perceived SES and parent SES were standarized prior to aggregating and school SES was coded as .5 and -.5 (to reflect 1/2 SD above and below the mean).
                       All three variables were then averaged to create the final composite.",
